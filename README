HTML-TagTree version 0.02
=========================

   The philosophy of HTML::TagTree is to let you create
   one region of code with lots of business logic 
   for rendering many possible resulting HTML files/output.
   This differs from the approach of using business logic code
   to decide which HTML template (of many) to render.
   So rather than maintaining many HTML templates, you
   maintain a Perl file that does all possible customizations
   of HTML generation.

   This module strives to minimize typing. Object treeing is
   just a simple method call, eg:
      $body->h1->b->i('This is a bold, italic heading');

   HTML::TagTree removes the worries of making simple HTML syntax
   errors such as no matching closing tag for an open tag.
